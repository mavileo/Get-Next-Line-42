# Get Next Line

This is the second project of course 42. It consists in carrying out a get_next_line function which allows to read line by line on a given fd. This function is very useful for reading a file line by line for example. Each line is retrieved in the char pointer whose address is passed as a parameter to the get_next_line function. Each row will be allocated dynamically using malloc, it is important to free each row after it is used to avoid memory leaks.
